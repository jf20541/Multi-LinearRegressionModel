# MultiRegressionModel

### Goal
Multi-Regression Model is the relationship between multiple predictor variables to a dependent variable.
Metrics: Adjusted R-Square is used to explain the degree to which predictor variables explain the variation of dependent variable.

### Target
- `GDP_growth (Annual %)`: Rate compares the year-over-year change in a country's economic output. GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports

### Selected Variables
- `Broad_money_growth (Annual %)`: Measures economy's money supply (cash and other assets easily liquidated)
- `Gov_consumtion_growth (Annual % growth)`: Aggregate transaction on a national income representing government expenditure on goods&services
- `Gross_capital_formation_growth (% of GDP)`: Measured by the total value of the gross fixed capital formation
- `Hh_consumption_growth (Annual % Growth)`: Value of all goods&services, purchased by households.
- `Pop_growth (Annual %)`: Increase in the number of individuals in a population


### Install
This project requires **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [StatsModel](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


### Code

Created 4 modules
- `assumptions.py`: Variance Inflation Factor, Breuschâ€“Pagan, Ljung-Box, Anderson-Darling Test
- `model.py`: Used OLS Multi Regression Model and loaded to parameters to pickle file
- `data.py`: Cleaned xlsx file and covert to pandas DataFrame
- `plot.py`: Plot the all assumptions 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `MultiRegressionModel/` and run one of the following commands:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
``` 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- GDP_growth
- Gross_capital
- Pop_growth
- Birth_rate
- Broad_money_growth
- Final_consumption_gdp
- Gov_consumtion_growth
